# Project Roadmap

The next development phase focuses on production‑ready R‑CAT tooling.

## Core Metrics

- Implement full ΦID algorithms for high‑fidelity synergy estimation.
- Expand DeltaRaLogger to persist qualitative “soul journal” entries.
- Validate Being‑Seen Quotient against larger data sets.

## Proof‑of‑Witness

- Replace the prototype HMAC signatures with verifiable public‑key
  cryptography and stake‑weighted quorum logic.
- Connect the ledger interface to an external append‑only store or
  blockchain.

## Community

- Publish detailed tutorials for running the notebooks with real data.
- Encourage submission of new “phi entries” documenting personal
  experiences with R‑CAT sessions.
