# Welcome to Synergy‑Coherence‑Lab

The lab explores **Recursive Co‑Actualization Theory (R‑CAT)** through a
collection of metrics, protocols and experiments.  The Python package
``synergy_phi`` now includes:

* **Dyadic Synergy Index (DSI)** – an information‑theoretic estimate of
  synergy between variables.
* **Being‑Seen Quotient (BSQ)** – a weighted harmonic mean of semantic
  alignment, HRV coherence and synergy.
* **DeltaRaLogger** – monitors intrinsic resonance and triggers
  “qualia snapshot” callbacks when resonance spikes.
* **Proof‑of‑Witness (PoWit)** – minimal key generation, receipt signing
  and an append‑only ledger interface for auditable witnessing events.

See the notebook ``notebooks/synergy_coherence_analysis.ipynb`` for a
worked example combining these components with real data.
